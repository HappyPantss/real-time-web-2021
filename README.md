## Assignment 2: Make it so!
This individual exercise is not alltogether different from assignment 1 - the one you did as a team.. remember? It even bears the same name! For assignment 2 (this one) you will collect all of your experience and go full-out on a unique realtime app. Again you will use readme driven development (RDD). Use this assignment to start your adventure towards comprehension of the realtime universe.

Readme
You have probably forked your team project at the end of last assignment. Create a new branch called ‘team-page’ and switch back to the main branch. By branching out we’ve created a snapshot of this repository at this point, you can always find the code by switching to the ‘team-page’ branch. You will be working on this project by yourself so there is no need to add collaborators to Github.

Think up unique features that will make your chat much more interesting. What is unique? Not unique are storing nicknames, showing who’s online or any of the other feature requests listed at the bottom of the socket.io tutorial. Unique is using D3 to structure text into SVG art, using words to fight each other in a text based game, additional features you can earn if you stay in chat long enough. It doesn’t even have to be a chat app, just use the socket.io framework.

Think of something that matches your skill level. If you have trouble understanding the basics of socket.io, focus on the basics (and talk to us if you need help).
